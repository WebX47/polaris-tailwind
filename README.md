Tried Setting up [shopify-design-system] [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens) using its tokens inside tailwind config.

## Bad

- Badly set up at the moment - Needs cleanup
- Renaming/reorganization of classes or maybe go the plugin route, will figure out later someday

## Future

- A good landing page with a few doc pages
- Pre-made core components just like Polaris official site needs to be provided else very few will pick this up if they need to write code even for a button then handle all the active, hover etc.

**\*I feel Polaris+VanillaTailwind+CSSModule is the best approach for now for my needs.**

- Polaris for pre-made components
- Tailwind, just because I like utility classes instead of writing CSS
- CSS Modules when I need to use Polaris tokens because the Polaris VSCode extension has autoComplete there

**Most likely I'll abandon this project unless I have a critical need for it. However, if someone else can build this out properly, I'd be very grateful.**
